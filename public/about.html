<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I was born on May 5, 1992, and I come from Eastern Slovakia. 
  My hometown is Tiszacsernyő, a charming place with a rich cultural heritage. 
  I embarked on my academic journey at Gyöngyös, where I pursued both my bachelor's and master's degrees.</p>

<p>Currently, I call Budapest my home, and I work as an accountant at a multinational corporation. 
  I've always had a passion for numbers and finance, which is why I find my work both engaging and fulfilling. 
  My love for sports and relaxation is equally important to me. 
  I'm an avid swimmer, enjoy various sports, and cherish moments of relaxation.</p>

<p>Life is a journey, and I embrace every new opportunity it brings. 
  Whether it's diving into a spreadsheet at work or diving into the pool for a refreshing swim, I'm always eager for new adventures and challenges. 
  I believe in the balance between work, sports, and leisure, and I'm excited to see where the path of life takes me next</p>
